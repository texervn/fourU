      A rewrite of the WeBWorK online homework system, in Django
    </div>

    <h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		fourU is a online homework system, giving teachers the ability to assign
		problems with randomly-generated numbers, and students the ability to
		get immediate feedback on answers.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>
		fourU was born out of frustration with the current contenders in the
		online homework system arena; xxx and yyy were too expensive for a small
		company, and <a href="http://webwork.maa.org">WeBWorK</a> provided
		constant attention from James, whose official job title was "Web
		Programmer", but should have been "Web Programmer / System Administrator
		/ Technical Support / General Technology Guy". It also provided a
		less-than-friendly interface, both for professors and students.
	</p>
	<p>
		These, then, are primary goals of the fourU project:
		<ul>
			<!-- these should be categorized and sorted... -->
			<li><b>As few dependencies as possible.</b> Required package
			versions should be either available in the repositories of the
			latest versions of Debian Stable and CentOS, or be easily
			installable by a non-sys-admin on common systems.</li>
			<li><b>Support for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</b> Attempts should
			be made to insure that fourU works on other operating systems, such
			as FreeBSD and Solaris, if they don't require extraordinary amounts
			of time or are otherwise detrimental to the project.</li>
			<li><b>Support for a wide variety of web servers.</b> One of
			WeBWorK's downfalls is a reliance on Apache; Even Apache 2.2
			support is experimental! Most installations don't need the advanced
			features that Apache provides, and so we encourage our users to try
			out one of the lightweight alternatives.</li>
			<li><b>Separation of backend logic and frontend presentation.</b> It
			should be easy for a non-programming designer to customize the
			appearance of your site, with less than an hour invested in learning
			the templating system.</li>
			<li><b>Clear, modular, well-organized, fully-documented code.</b>
			It's hard enough convincing people to work on your code base as it
			is; we want to lower the entry barrier as much as possible.</li>
			<li><b>Unit tests that cover a large part of the code base.</b>
			Automated regression testing on a multitude of different platforms
			and configurations is a great way to prevent "This worked in version
			x.xx, but now..." messages.</li>
			<li><b>Up-to-date documentation.</b> It's always frustrating when
			you're setting up a new piece of software, and the instructions
			you're reading don't match what you see. Programmers notoriously
			hate writing documentation, but we won't merge in patches to the
			code base without patches to the docs, if they will introduce any
			changes visible to the end-user.</li>
			<li><b>A "Worse is Better" approach to UI design.</b> Influenced
			much by Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think", we want to provide the
			user with only a few, simple choices at any given time. If you need
			to drill-down some specifics for one of those, you can ask them
			later.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Questions</h2>
	<div class="qa-pair">
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Why write this yourself, rather than use the existing WeBWorK
		codebase? <a
		href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">Joel
		says</a> you should never do this!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Of the three reasons Joel mentions programmers give for
		rewriting code, the "architectural problems" are the closest to what we
		felt with WeBWorK.
		<ol>
			<li>Much of the code would not actually be rewritten, but rather use
			the already rewritten (and proven) implementations present in the
			framework and various libraries.</li>
			<li>James doesn't know Perl nearly well enough to undertake
			something of that magnitude :). A short experiment was tried, and we
			found that a) we couldn't find any local Perl hackers and b)
			outsourced Perl programmers at the price we needed required far too
			much micromanagement.  That, then, was the end of Perl.</li>
		</ol>
		You'll note that rewrites are sometimes extremely successful: both the
		Windows NT kernel (upon which XP was based) and Mac OS X are widely
		accepted as being tremendous improvements over their predeccesors.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="qa-pair">
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> Ok, but why Python?
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Well, that all depends on what you're thinking it should have been instead. ;)
	</p>
	<p>
		Java and .NET have far too much overhead to be either developed or
		deployed quickly and easily. Rails has a tendency to be both magical and
		opinionated, both things that James feels make development difficult
		(although, obviously, many people have done very well with it). More
		importantly, Ruby's userland libraries are still in a fairly young
		stage; they're growing at an incredible rate, but they couldn't compare
		(at the time the decision was made) to the wealth of Python libraries.
	</p>
	<p>
		PHP was the initial decision, actually. It's a dynamically-typed
		language with a large number of libraries, code snippets and users, and
		was designed for the web specifically. It's also one of the most common
		server-side languages, and is available on free and cheap shared hosts
		everywhere. After having forsaken PHP for a year for the Python creed,
		however, James found himself constantly doing all in his power to use a
		PHP version of Django, and so, he decided to use the real thing instead.

	<div class="qa-pair">
	<p>
		<b>Q:</b> What about [insert Python framework here]?
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Django has:
		<ul>
			<li>A 1.0 release, with guarenteed API stability</li>
			<li>A large userbase</li>
			<li>Active development</li>
			<li>Excellent and extensive documentation</li>
			<li>A wide variety of 3rd-party middlewares</li>
			<li>Tightly-coherent components that allow you to get going with
			minimal fuss</li>
			<li>...and loosely-couple components so that you can swap out pieces
			as needed.</li>
