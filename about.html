      A rewrite of the WeBWorK online homework system, in Django
    </div>

    <h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		fourU is a online homework system, giving teachers the ability to assign
		problems with randomly-generated numbers, and students the ability to
		get immediate feedback on answers.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>
		fourU was born out of frustration with the current contenders in the
		online homework system arena; xxx and yyy were too expensive for a small
		company, and <a href="http://webwork.maa.org">WeBWorK</a> provided
		constant attention from James, whose official job title was "Web
		Programmer", but should have been "Web Programmer / System Administrator
		/ Technical Support / General Technology Guy". It also provided a
		less-than-friendly interface, both for professors and students.
	</p>
	<p>
		These, then, are primary goals of the fourU project:
		<ul>
			<!-- these should be categorized and sorted... -->
			<li><b>As few dependencies as possible.</b> Required package
			versions should be either available in the repositories of the
			latest versions of Debian Stable and CentOS, or be easily
			installable by a non-sys-admin on common systems.</li>
			<li><b>Support for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.</b> Attempts should
			be made to insure that fourU works on other operating systems, such
			as FreeBSD and Solaris, if they don't require extraordinary amounts
			of time or are otherwise detrimental to the project.</li>
			<li><b>Support for a wide variety of web servers.</b> One of
			WeBWorK's downfalls is a reliance on Apache 1.3; Even Apache 2
			support is experimental! Most installations don't need the advanced
			features that Apache provides, and so we encourage our users to try
			out one of the lightweight alternatives.</li>
			<li><b>Separation of backend logic and frontend presentation.</b> It
			should be easy for a non-programming designer to customize the
			appearance of your site, with less than an hour invested in learning
			the templating system.</li>
			<li><b>Clear, modular, well-organized, fully-documented code.</b>
			It's hard enough convincing people to work on your code base as it
			is; we want to lower the entry barrier as much as possible.</li>
			<li><b>Unit tests that cover a large part of the code base.</b>
			Automated regression testing on a multitude of different platforms
			and configurations is a great way to prevent "This worked in version
			x.xx, but now..." messages.</li>
			<li><b>Up-to-date documentation.</b> It's always frustrating when
			you're setting up a new piece of software, and the instructions
			you're reading don't match what you see. Programmers notoriously
			hate writing documentation, but we won't merge in patches to the
			code base without patches to the docs, if they will introduce any
			changes visible to the end-user.</li>
			<li><b>A "Worse is Better" approach to UI design.</b> Influenced
			much by Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think", we want to provide the
			user with only a few, simple choices at any given time. If you need
			to drill-down some specifics for one of those, you can ask them
			later.</li>
		</ul>
